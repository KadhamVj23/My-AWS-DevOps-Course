# AWS Basics for DevOps

## What is Cloud Computing?

**Cloud Computing** is like renting computing services like: storage, softwares, databases, servers over the internet instead of owning or maintaining your physical hardware.

Below are some examples:

👉 Streaming Movies (Netflix): You watch movies from Netflix's servers, not from a DVD player in your home.

👉 Online Storage (Google Drive/Dropbox): Your files live online, accessible from any device, not just your computer's hard drive.

👉 Email (Gmail): Your emails are stored on Google's servers, not on your personal computer. 

There are **3** types of services provided by Cloud. They are:

### 1. SaaS - Software As A Service

- **SaaS** is the most user friendly service, it provides a complete application hosted in the Cloud. So instead of purchasing and installing them in the systems, you can use them over the internet.

- Here the applications are ready to use, and the maintainance & updates are handled by the provider.

- Examples for SaaS providers are: Zoom, Gmail, Slack, Microsoft 365 for office productivity tools.


### 2. PaaS - Platform As A Service

- **PaaS** offers a cloud environment where you can develop, run and manage applications, without dealing with the complexities of managing the infrastuructre.

- It provides tools for development, hosting and runtime management. 

- It is mainly for developers who want to focus on developing the application instead of worring about managing harware or Operating System.

- For example: A software development company building a SaaS product can use Google App Engine or AWS Elastic Beanstalk to deploy their web application without worrying about setting up servers, networking, or storage.

- Popular service providers for PaaS are: AWS Lambda, Google App Engine, Google Cloud, IBM Cloud.


### 3. IaaS - Infrastructure As A Service

- **IaaS** provides virtualized computing services like: storage, servers, databases and networking over the internet on a **Pay As you Go** basis instead of managing the physical hardware. It gives more scalabitly for businesses of all sizes.

- Scaling up or down based on your needs is easy and you will have a control over it

- For example: A tech startup might need to scale its infrastructure quickly as traffic spikes. Using IaaS, such as Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure, so that they can easily increase their server capacity without investing in expensive hardware.

Popular IaaS providers are: AWS, Microsoft Azure. 


## Why Cloud Computing

Before cloud computing existed, companies had to buy and manage physical servers to run their websites and applications.

For example, imagine a startup in the past that launched a new application. To run it, the company had to purchase physical servers. Once they bought these servers, they also needed:

- A dedicated room or data center to store the servers

- Cooling systems to prevent overheating

- Power backup or generators in case electricity failed

- IT staff to manage, monitor, and maintain the servers

- Security measures to protect servers from attacks and theft


All of this required high upfront cost, time, and maintenance.

Now consider a real scenario like a Black Friday sale. During the sale, a large number of users suddenly visit the website. Because of the heavy traffic, the website becomes slow or crashes. To handle this extra load, the company would need to buy additional physical servers.


However, once the sale is over, the traffic drops back to normal. At this point, the extra servers are no longer needed, but the company cannot return them. This leads to:

- Wasted money

- Unused infrastructure

- Ongoing maintenance costs

This situation became a **major headache for companies.**

### How Cloud Computing Solved This Problem

To overcome these challenges, cloud computing was introduced.

### With cloud computing:

- Companies can rent servers instead of buying them

- They can increase or decrease resources instantly

- They pay only for what they use

- No need to worry about hardware, power, cooling, or physical security


During high traffic (like a Black Friday sale), companies can easily scale up resources. When traffic reduces, they can scale down, saving cost and effort.

This flexibility, scalability, and cost efficiency is why cloud computing became so popular and essential today.
